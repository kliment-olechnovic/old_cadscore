== Note ==

Please note that the new CAD-score implementation is the "voronota-cadscore"
script in the Voronota package that is available from:

https://github.com/kliment-olechnovic/voronota/releases


== Overview ==

CAD-score is a command-line software that constructs the Voronoi diagram
of protein atom spheres, calculates inter-atom contact surfaces
and uses them to compare protein structures of the same sequence.


== Preparing to use ==

Download the latest package from CAD-score downloads page:

https://github.com/kliment-olechnovic/old_cadscore/releases

A compiled static executable for GNU/Linux is included in the package.
However, it is recommended to rebuild the executable
using the following command:

g++ -O3 -o bin/voroprot2 src/*.cpp
