File "enhanced_table" contains scores for CASP9 models. The following rules apply:
1) Target 629 was discarded.
2) Contains only server groups.
3) Contains only solid groups (group is considered to be solid if all its models have atoms/residues ratio bigger than 6.5).
4) Domain "0" means full structure model.

Lists of the server groups included (not included) into "enhanced_table" are in the files "list_of_used_servers" ("list_of_unused_servers").

Correlation analysis was performed for single domains only. The file "correlation_table" contains correlation coefficients and model counts.
The directory "plot_correlation_analysis" contains the corresponding plots.

The file "agreement_table" contains sizes of various sets used for MolProbity difference analysis.
It was generated from the file scores differences values from the file "pairs_differences_table".
