  This software, QTFier, creates a text file (QTF file) containing the quasi-             
  triangulation of a set of spherical balls (or atoms) which is the dual        
  structure of the Voronoi diagram of the balls. Refer to the following         
  papers for more details on the quasi-triangulation.

    - For molecules, QTFier (currently) uses the atomic radii reported in:

        Chemistry, 68(3), pp. 441-451, 1964.                                   
      (To use other radii values, contact Deok-Soo Kim.)

                          (.mol and .mol2 will be available later.)                                                     
                                                                               
Usage:                                                                         
  QTFier [OPTION]  [INPUT_FILE]  [OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]                              
    Generate the QTF file for INPUT_FILE and store in OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.
    For the details of the file format, see the reference 3 above. 
                                                                                                                                                              
Input Options:                                                                                                                                              
  -HOH           : HOH atoms in PDB_file are included in the computation of    
                   the quasi-triangulation.  
                   Without this option, QTFier computes the quasi-triangulation
                   after water molecules are removed.
                   Note that this option applies for PDB file (.pdb) only.
